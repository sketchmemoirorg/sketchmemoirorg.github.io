Hello, Welcome and thank you for visiting Sketchmemoir! Sketchmemoir has been one of my long awaited wishlist action. I have been wanting to create a blogsite primarily for 2 reasons.
Reason1 is to cultivate a hobby outside corporate environment and nothing more powerful and meaningful than writing came to my mind.
Reason2 is to share my life-experiences.
Most of my friends asked, ‘Would you be writing technical blogs?’. 17 years of work has given my surrounding world an image that I am passionate about, Technology and defacto I would end up writing technical gyan blogs. Well, then my hobby gets tied to my job and I wished to do something different. Over time, the individual I have molded to be is a sheer result of the experiences life has taught me and the people I have had the opportunity to connect with. Lessons learnt, melted moments, merciless emotions, thought provoking discussions, healing advices have enabled me to have a beautiful perspective for life. I intend to pen them down so that one can relate, one can share, one can learn from my life experiences and here is my Sketchmemoir.

I would like to Thank Nagesh DN for helping me build this blog site and continues to support me.
