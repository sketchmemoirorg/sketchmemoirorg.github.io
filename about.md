Hello, Welcome and thank you for visiting Sketchmemoir! Sketchmemoir has been one of my long awaited wishlist action. I have been wanting to create a blogsite primarily for 2 reasons.
One of the prime reason is to cultivate a hobby outside corporate environment and nothing more powerful and meaningful than writing came to my mind.
Another most important reason is to share my life-experiences. Most of my friends asked, ‘Would you be writing technical blogs?’. 17 years of work has given my surrounding world an image that I am passionate about, Technology and defacto I would end up writing technical gyan blogs. Well, then my hobby gets tied to my job and I wished to do something different. Over time, the individual I have molded to be is a sheer result of the experiences life has taught me and the people I have had the opportunity to connect with. Lessons learnt, melted moments, merciless emotions, thought provoking discussions, healing advices have enabled me to have a beautiful perspective for life. I intend to pen them down so that one can relate, one can share, one can learn from my life experiences and here is my Sketchmemoir.

Humble thanks to Nagesh DN for helping me build this blog site and his continued support.
